# ICAA-master

The implementation of ICAA(inter-dimensional correlations aggregated attention networks)

## 1. You should firstly download HMDB-51 and UCF-101 datasets in ICAA-master/dataset

## 2. Then extract TVL1-flow follows : https://github.com/JianhaoZhan/RGB-Flow_extrating

## 3. Our trained ICAA-ResNeXt-101 can downloads follows : ICAA-master/final_model/readme.txt

## 4. Finally, the train/test code follows : ICAA-master/readme.txt
